To use this script to compare two csv files and quickly print out the mismatched rows, you will need to do a few things:

1.) Make sure that Python3 is installed on your PC -> Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.) Make sure that the column content is ordered to be uniform in each csv file before running the script
3.) Run IDLE and open compare.py -> Alternatively you can right click on compare.py and select 'Edit with IDLE'
4.) Run the script in IDLE by either pressing F5, or by clicking Run from the toolbar
5.) It will prompt you to select the two files you are comparing as soon as the script is run
6.) It will output the mismatched rows into a separate window titled 'Compare CSV'

I have stored two test sheets to compare in this folder



AS OF 1/23: No need to store the script within the same directory as the files you are comparing
